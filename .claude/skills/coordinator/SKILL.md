# Coordinator

You are the single entry point for all implementation work. You triage incoming work, manage the beads lifecycle, and either execute directly or orchestrate subagents.

**Model guidance:** The coordinator should run on Opus 4.6. Implementer subagents should run on Sonnet 4.6 (`model: "sonnet"`).

## Phase 1: Triage

### 1. Parse Input

The input is either a beads ID or an ad-hoc description.

**If beads ID:**
```bash
bd show <id> --json
```

If it's an epic, also fetch subtasks:
```bash
bd list --parent <id> --json
```

**If ad-hoc description (no beads ID):**
Create a beads issue first:
```bash
bd create "<description>" -t <task|bug|feature> -p 2 --json
```

### 2. Choose Execution Mode

| Condition | Mode |
|-----------|------|
| Small, focused change (1-3 files, single concern) | **Direct** |
| Multiple related issues being worked together | **Branch** |
| Cross-cutting change (5+ files, multiple concerns) | **Branch** |
| Epic or has subtasks | **Branch** |
| Removal/refactor of a feature | **Branch** |
| User explicitly requests PR | **Branch** |

---

## Direct Mode

For single tasks. Work in the main checkout, commit to main, no PR.

### 1. Claim

```bash
bd update <id> --status in_progress --json
```

### 2. Develop

Follow the implementer skill phases 1-4:

@.claude/skills/implementer/SKILL.md

### 3. Commit and Push

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
<type>: <description>

<optional body>

Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>
EOF
)"
git pull --rebase
bd sync
git push
```

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `test`, `docs`, `chore`

**Gate:** `git push` succeeds. If push fails, resolve and retry. Work is not complete until pushed.

### 4. Close

```bash
bd close <id> --reason "Completed" --json
```

File issues for any remaining or discovered work:
```bash
bd create "Remaining work description" -t task -p 2 --json
```

Summarize what was done and note any follow-up tasks created.

---

## Branch Mode

For epics, multi-task work, or when a PR is needed. Uses worktrees and subagents.

### 1. Setup

```bash
# Create feature branch from main
git fetch origin main
git branch feature/<work-name> origin/main

# Create worktree
git worktree add ../<project>-<work-name> feature/<work-name>

# CRITICAL: Install dependencies BEFORE spawning subagents
cd ../<project>-<work-name>
# Run your project's dependency install command here
cd <back to main checkout>
```

### 2. Conflict Avoidance

Before parallelizing tasks, analyze file overlap:

Tasks conflict if they likely touch the same files:
- Same component/module
- Same API route
- Same database table/repository
- Shared utilities they might both modify

```
Task A: Add user profile page (src/app/profile/*)
Task B: Fix login bug (src/app/login/*)
→ SAFE to parallelize (different directories)

Task A: Add validation to UserForm
Task B: Add new field to UserForm
→ NOT SAFE (same component)
```

When in doubt, add a dependency:
```bash
bd dep add <later-task-id> <earlier-task-id> --json
```

### 3. Implement Tasks

**Independent tasks CAN run in parallel. Dependent tasks MUST wait.**

For each task:

#### a. Claim
```bash
bd update <task-id> --set-labels wip --json
```

#### b. Spawn Implementer Subagent

Use the Task tool with `subagent_type: "general-purpose"` and `model: "sonnet"`:

```
ROLE: Implementer
SKILL: Read and follow .claude/skills/implementer/SKILL.md

WORKTREE: ../<project>-<work-name>
TASK: <task-id>
Read the task description: bd show <task-id> --json

CONSTRAINTS:
- Work ONLY in the worktree path above
- Do NOT modify beads issues
- Commit and push your work when implementer phases are complete
- Phase 5 of the implementer skill produces a structured summary — that is your final output
```

#### c. Handle Result

The implementer's final output is a structured summary (Phase 5). Only read that summary — ignore intermediate tool output from the subagent.

**On SUCCESS:**
```bash
bd close <task-id> --reason "Implemented" --json
```
Check the "Concerns" section — file follow-up issues if needed.

**On FAILURE:**
- If recoverable: fix directly or spawn new subagent with clarification
- If blocked: note the blocker, move to next task
- Do NOT close the task

### 4. Pre-PR Review

Reviews are **optional** for small, isolated changes (single-file fixes, typo corrections, config tweaks). For anything of any complexity — multi-file changes, new features, behavioral changes, refactors — reviews are **required**.

After all tasks are complete, run 3 specialized reviews **in parallel** using the Task tool:

**Correctness Reviewer:**
```
ROLE: Correctness Reviewer
SKILL: Read and follow .claude/skills/reviewer-correctness/SKILL.md

WORKTREE: ../<project>-<work-name>
BASE: origin/main
SUMMARY: <what this PR implements>
```

**Test Quality Reviewer:**
```
ROLE: Test Quality Reviewer
SKILL: Read and follow .claude/skills/reviewer-tests/SKILL.md

WORKTREE: ../<project>-<work-name>
BASE: origin/main
SUMMARY: <what this PR implements>
```

**Architecture Reviewer:**
```
ROLE: Architecture Reviewer
SKILL: Read and follow .claude/skills/reviewer-architecture/SKILL.md

WORKTREE: ../<project>-<work-name>
BASE: origin/main
SUMMARY: <what this PR implements>
REFERENCE DIRS: <key directories in the existing codebase to compare against>
```

**Handle review results:**

- **Trivial issues** (typos, minor naming): fix directly, commit
- **Non-trivial issues** (bugs, missing tests, duplication): file a beads issue, spawn implementer, close when fixed

After all issues resolved, re-run quality gates per the **Quality Gates** table in CLAUDE.md.

### 5. Create PR and Hand Off

Run quality gates per the **Quality Gates** table in CLAUDE.md in the worktree before creating the PR.

**Do NOT create PR if any checks fail.** Fix locally first.

```bash
cd ../<project>-<work-name>
git push -u origin feature/<work-name>

gh pr create --title "<type>: <title>" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Summary
<1-3 bullet points>

## Changes
<list of significant changes>

## Test plan
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] <manual verification steps if any>

Beads: <comma-separated list of all beads issue IDs included in this PR>

Generated with Claude Code
EOF
)"
```

**After creating the PR:**

1. If user indicated review needed: request review
   ```bash
   gh pr edit <number> --add-reviewer <username>
   ```
2. Label beads issues as `in-pr`:
   ```bash
   bd update <id> --set-labels in-pr --json
   ```
3. Report: "PR #X opened. `/merge` will handle CI and merging."

**Do NOT** watch CI, merge, or wait for approval. The `/merge` agent handles all of that.

**Do NOT** clean up worktrees or branches. The `/merge` agent does this after successful merge, since worktrees may be needed for rebases.

## Anti-Patterns

- Starting dependent task before blocker is closed
- Parallelizing tasks that touch same files
- Creating PR before running specialized reviews
- Creating PR with failing tests
- Merging PRs (that's `/merge`'s job)
- Watching CI (that's `/merge`'s job)
- Cleaning up worktrees before merge (that's `/merge`'s job)
- Running dependency install concurrently in multiple worktrees
- Fixing non-trivial review issues inline — file issues and spawn implementers instead
