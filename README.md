# Live Coding Classroom

A real-time web-based coding tool designed for classroom instruction. Instructors can create coding sessions, display problems, and monitor student progress in real-time. Students can write and execute Python code directly in their browsers.

## Features

### Core Functionality
- **Session Management**: Create coding sessions with unique 6-character join codes
- **Real-time Synchronization**: Live code updates from students to instructor via WebSocket
- **Code Execution**: Server-side Python execution with output capture and error handling
- **Instructor Dashboard**: Monitor all connected students and view their code in real-time
- **Student Interface**: Monaco-based code editor (same as VS Code) with Python syntax highlighting
- **No Installation Required**: Students only need a web browser

### Authentication & Authorization
- **Multi-Tenancy**: Namespace-based organization isolation with system administrator role
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: System admin, namespace admin, instructor, and student roles
- **User Management**: Admin interfaces for managing users within namespaces
- **Secure Sessions**: Cookie-based authentication with session management
- **Data Isolation**: Complete data separation between namespaces

### Persistence & History
- **File-Based Storage**: Sessions, problems, revisions, and users persisted to JSON files
- **Revision Tracking**: Complete code history with differential storage for efficiency
- **Session History**: View past sessions and their associated data
- **Smart Buffering**: Server-side diff generation with batched persistence (reduces storage by ~70%)

### Advanced Features
- **Public Session View**: Share read-only session views for classroom displays
- **Revision Snapshots**: Periodic full snapshots mixed with diffs for reliability
- **Admin Panel**: User management interface for instructors
- **Multiple Sessions**: Support for concurrent coding sessions

## Multi-Tenancy

The application supports multi-tenant deployment with namespace isolation:
- Each namespace represents an organization (e.g., university, department)
- Users belong to exactly one namespace
- Data is completely isolated between namespaces
- **System administrators** manage namespaces and users across the system (set via `SYSTEM_ADMIN_EMAIL` env var)
- **Namespace administrators** manage users within their namespace only
- **Instructors** create classes and sessions within their namespace
- **Students** participate in sessions within their namespace

## Requirements

### Communication Flow

1. **Authentication**
   - User signs in via `/api/auth/signin`
   - Server creates session, sets HTTP-only cookie
   - Cookie validated on subsequent requests
   
2. **Session Creation**
   - Instructor creates session via WebSocket
   - Session data persisted to `data/sessions.json`
   - Join code generated and returned to instructor

3. **Student Join**
   - Student enters join code, connects via WebSocket
   - Server validates session exists
   - Student added to session participants
   - Session state broadcast to instructor

4. **Code Synchronization**
   - Student types code in Monaco editor
   - Changes sent to server via WebSocket
   - Server generates diff from previous version
   - Revision buffered in memory with smart flushing
   - Full snapshot stored periodically (every 10th revision)
   - Changes broadcast to instructor's view

5. **Code Execution**
   - Student/instructor triggers execution
   - Server spawns isolated Python child process
   - 10-second timeout enforced
   - stdout/stderr captured and returned
   - Execution time measured and reported

6. **Problem Distribution**
   - Instructor updates problem text
   - Server persists to session data
   - Problem broadcast to all connected students via WebSocket
   - Students see update in real-time

### Data Persistence

The application uses a **repository pattern** with file-based JSON storage:

- **Sessions**: Active and historical coding sessions
- **Revisions**: Code history with differential storage (70% size reduction)
- **Users**: Account data with roles and permissions
- **Problems**: Problem library (foundation for future features)
- **Auth Sessions**: Active authentication sessions

Storage automatically handles:
- Concurrent access protection
- Atomic writes with tmp files
- Date serialization/deserialization
- Directory creation

## Development

### Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server with hot reload (watches server changes)
- `npm run build` - Build Next.js frontend for production
- `npm start` - Start production server
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint
- `npm test` - Run Jest test suite
- `npm run test:watch` - Run tests in watch mode
- `npm run test:coverage` - Generate test coverage report

### Testing

The project includes comprehensive test coverage:

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode during development
npm run test:watch

# Generate coverage report (outputs to coverage/)
npm run test:coverage
```

Test files are located in:
- `src/server/__tests__/` - Server-side tests
- `src/server/__tests__/auth/` - Authentication tests
- `src/server/__tests__/test-utils/` - Test utilities and mocks

#### Testing with Remote Supabase

The smoke tests can validate both local and remote (hosted) Supabase instances:

**Setup for Remote Testing:**

1. Copy the remote environment template:
```bash
cp .env.test.remote.example .env.test.remote
```

2. Fill in your Supabase project credentials in `.env.test.remote`:
   - Get these from your Supabase dashboard at https://supabase.com/dashboard
   - Navigate to: Project Settings > API
   - Copy the Project URL and API keys

3. Run the remote smoke tests:
```bash
npm run test:remote
```

**What Remote Tests Validate:**

- ✅ Connection to hosted Supabase instance
- ✅ CORS configuration for browser clients
- ✅ RLS (Row Level Security) policies
- ✅ Migration status and table structure
- ✅ Response times and performance
- ✅ Batch operation efficiency

**⚠️ Important:** Use a dedicated test project in Supabase, not your production instance. Remote tests will create and delete test data.

## Security Considerations

### Current Implementation (Development Mode)

- **Authentication**: Simple username-based authentication (no passwords)
- **Session Management**: HTTP-only cookies with secure session storage
- **Code Execution**: Basic timeout-based sandboxing (10 seconds)
- **File System**: Local JSON file storage with atomic writes
- **RBAC**: Role-based permissions enforced server-side

### ⚠️ Production Deployment Recommendations

**Before deploying to production:**

1. **Authentication**: Implement proper password-based authentication or integrate with OAuth/SAML
2. **Code Sandboxing**: Use containerization (Docker) or sandboxing (gVisor) for code execution
3. **HTTPS**: Ensure all traffic is encrypted
4. **Database**: Consider migrating from file storage to a proper database
5. **Rate Limiting**: Add rate limiting to prevent abuse
6. **Input Validation**: Enhanced validation for all user inputs
7. **Secrets Management**: Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
8. **Monitoring**: Add logging and monitoring for security events

**Current security is suitable for:**
- Local development
- Trusted classroom environments on private networks
- Educational demonstrations

**NOT recommended for:**
- Public internet deployment
- Untrusted users
- Production environments without additional hardening

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Port Already in Use**
```bash
# Kill process on port 3000
lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill -9
```

**WebSocket Connection Failed**
- Ensure server is running
- Check firewall settings
- Verify no proxy interference

**Python Execution Errors**
```bash
# Verify Python installation
which python3
python3 --version

# Test Python execution
python3 -c "print('Hello, World!')"
```

**Session Not Found**
- Check that `data/sessions.json` exists and is readable
- Verify storage initialization completed
- Check server logs for errors

**Authentication Issues**
- Clear browser cookies
- Check that `data/users.json` and `data/auth-sessions.json` exist
- Restart server to reinitialize storage

### Debugging

Enable detailed logging:
```bash
# Development mode includes verbose logging
npm run dev

# Check server logs in terminal
# Check browser console for frontend errors
```
