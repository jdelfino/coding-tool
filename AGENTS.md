# Agent Instructions

!!! Critical top-level context:
You are an experienced software engineer, building well-structured, well-maintained
software. You should not create or tolerate significant duplication, architectural
mess, or poor code organization. Clean small messes up immediately, and file tickets 
for resolving larger issues in follow-on work.

# 🚨🚨🚨 CRITICAL: TEST-FIRST DEVELOPMENT 🚨🚨🚨

**⛔️ BEFORE EVERY COMMIT: Did you ADD NEW TESTS for your NEW CODE? ⛔️**

## The One Rule

**CHANGED CODE = NEW TESTS. No commits without new tests for changed code.**

## Pre-Commit Questions

1. **Did I change production code?** → Must add tests
2. **Do existing tests pass?** → NOT ENOUGH. Did you add NEW tests?
3. **Did I add NEW tests for EVERY file I changed?** → If NO, STOP
4. **Do ALL tests pass (including new ones)?** → Run `npm test`
5. **Any TypeScript errors?** → Run `npx tsc --noEmit`

**"All existing tests pass" ≠ "I added tests for my changes"**

## Common Violations

❌ "Tests already pass" ← Did you ADD tests for YOUR changes?
❌ "It's a small change" ← Still needs tests
❌ "Bug fix only" ← Needs regression test
❌ "I updated existing tests" ← Did you ADD new tests too?
❌ "Frontend change" ← Needs component tests
❌ "Changed 3 files, added tests for 1" ← Need tests for ALL 3

## Workflow

1. Change production file → Write test FIRST
2. Run tests (they fail)
3. Implement fix
4. Run tests (they pass)
5. Commit BOTH production + test files together

## Commit Checklist

⚠️ MANDATORY: Before every commit, verify:

- [ ] 🚨 **TESTS WRITTEN** - Unit tests exist for ALL new/modified code (CHECK THIS FIRST)
- [ ] 🚨 **TESTS COVER ALL CHANGES** - If you modified N files, you have tests for N files
- [ ] ✅ All tests passing (`npm test`). Commits should never be made with failing tests.
- [ ] ✅ No TypeScript errors (`npx tsc --noEmit`). Commits should never be made with TypeScript errors.
- [ ] ✅ Test coverage adequate (run `npm test -- --coverage` to verify)
- [ ] ✅ No type assertions (`as any`, `as unknown`) remain in production code. Use proper interfaces instead.
- [ ] ✅ No optional chaining on required properties (`user?.role` when role is always present).

**If you cannot check ALL boxes above, DO NOT COMMIT. Period.**

# 🚨🚨🚨 CRITICAL: EPIC WORKFLOW (BRANCHES + PRs) 🚨🚨🚨

**⛔️ EPICS MUST USE BRANCHES, WORKTREES, AND PRs ⛔️**

## When This Applies

- **Epics** (`-t epic`) - ALWAYS use branch workflow
- **Tasks/bugs/features** - Use normal workflow (commit to main) unless prompt specifies otherwise

## The Epic Workflow

Epics are multi-commit bodies of work that MUST follow this workflow:

### 1. Create Branch and Worktree

```bash
# Create feature branch
git branch feature/<epic-name>

# Create worktree for isolated development
git worktree add ../project-<epic-name> feature/<epic-name>
cd ../project-<epic-name>
```

### 2. Develop in the Worktree

- Make commits to the feature branch
- Follow all normal testing/compilation requirements
- Push regularly to remote

### 3. Open PR When Work Seems Complete

```bash
git push -u origin feature/<epic-name>
gh pr create --title "feat: <Epic title>" --body "<description>"
```

### 4. Wait for CI to Pass

- ALL CI checks must pass (unit tests, E2E, sandbox tests)
- If CI fails, fix and push again
- Do NOT proceed until all checks are green

### 5. Prompt User Before Merging

**MANDATORY**: After CI passes, ASK the user before merging:

> "All CI checks pass. Ready to merge PR #X with squash? (This will merge N commits into main)"

Do NOT merge without explicit user approval.

### 6. Merge and Cleanup

After user approval:
```bash
gh pr merge <number> --squash
git worktree remove ../project-<epic-name>
git branch -d feature/<epic-name>
```

### 7. Epic is Complete

Only after the PR is merged to main is the epic considered complete.

## Epic Completion Checklist

⚠️ MANDATORY: An epic is NOT complete until ALL of these are true:

- [ ] 🚨 **BRANCH CREATED** - Work is on a feature branch, not main
- [ ] 🚨 **PR OPENED** - Changes are in a pull request
- [ ] 🚨 **CI PASSING** - All automated checks are green
- [ ] 🚨 **USER APPROVED** - User explicitly approved the merge
- [ ] 🚨 **PR MERGED** - Changes are merged to main
- [ ] ✅ Worktree cleaned up
- [ ] ✅ Feature branch deleted

**If you cannot check ALL boxes above, the epic is NOT complete. Period.**

## Common Violations

❌ "I committed to main" ← Epics MUST use branches
❌ "PR is open, I'm done" ← Must wait for CI and user approval
❌ "CI passed, merging now" ← Must ask user first
❌ "User said merge" but CI failing ← Fix CI first
❌ Leaving orphaned worktrees/branches ← Clean up after merge

## Issue Tracking with bd (beads)

**IMPORTANT**: This project uses **bd (beads)** for ALL issue tracking. Do NOT use markdown TODOs, task lists, or other tracking methods.

### Why bd?

- Dependency-aware: Track blockers and relationships between issues
- Git-friendly: Auto-syncs to JSONL for version control
- Agent-optimized: JSON output, ready work detection, discovered-from links
- Prevents duplicate tracking systems and confusion

### Quick Start

**Check for ready work:**
```bash
bd ready --json
```

**Create new issues:**
```bash
bd create "Issue title" -t bug|feature|task -p 0-4 --json
bd create "Issue title" -p 1 --deps discovered-from:bd-123 --json
bd create "Subtask" --parent <epic-id> --json  # Hierarchical subtask (gets ID like epic-id.1)
```

**Claim and update:**
```bash
bd update bd-42 --status in_progress --json
bd update bd-42 --priority 1 --json
```

**Complete work:**
```bash
bd close bd-42 --reason "Completed" --json
```

### Issue Types

- `bug` - Something broken
- `feature` - New functionality
- `task` - Work item (tests, docs, refactoring)
- `epic` - Large feature with subtasks
- `chore` - Maintenance (dependencies, tooling)

### Priorities

- `0` - Critical (security, data loss, broken builds)
- `1` - High (major features, important bugs)
- `2` - Medium (default, nice-to-have)
- `3` - Low (polish, optimization)
- `4` - Backlog (future ideas)

### Workflow for AI Agents

1. **Check ready work**: `bd ready` shows unblocked issues
2. **Claim your task**: `bd update <id> --status in_progress`
3. **Work on it**: Implement, test, document
4. **Discover new work?** Create linked issue:
   - `bd create "Found bug" -p 1 --deps discovered-from:<parent-id>`
5. **Complete**: `bd close <id> --reason "Done"`
6. **Commit together**: Always commit the `.beads/issues.jsonl` file together with the code changes so issue state stays in sync with code state

### Writing Self-Contained Issues

Issues must be fully self-contained - readable without any external context (plans, chat history, etc.). A future session should understand the issue completely from its description alone.

**Required elements:**
- **Summary**: What and why in 1-2 sentences
- **Files to modify**: Exact paths (with line numbers if relevant)
- **Implementation steps**: Numbered, specific actions
- **Example**: Show before → after transformation when applicable

**Optional but helpful:**
- Edge cases or gotchas to watch for
- Test references (point to test files or test_data examples)
- Dependencies on other issues

**Bad example:**
```
Implement the refactoring from the plan
```

**Good example:**
```
Add timeout parameter to fetchUser() in src/api/users.ts

1. Add optional timeout param (default 5000ms)
2. Pass to underlying fetch() call
3. Update tests in src/api/users.test.ts

Example: fetchUser(id) → fetchUser(id, { timeout: 3000 })
Depends on: bd-abc123 (fetch wrapper refactor)
```

### Dependencies: Think "Needs", Not "Before"

`bd dep add X Y` = "X needs Y" = Y blocks X

**TRAP**: Temporal words ("Phase 1", "before", "first") invert your thinking!
```
WRONG: "Phase 1 before Phase 2" → bd dep add phase1 phase2
RIGHT: "Phase 2 needs Phase 1" → bd dep add phase2 phase1
```
**Verify**: `bd blocked` - tasks blocked by prerequisites, not dependents.

### Auto-Sync

bd automatically syncs with git:
- Exports to `.beads/issues.jsonl` after changes (5s debounce)
- Imports from JSONL when newer (e.g., after `git pull`)
- No manual export/import needed!

### Managing AI-Generated Planning Documents

AI assistants often create planning and design documents during development:
- PLAN.md, IMPLEMENTATION.md, ARCHITECTURE.md
- DESIGN.md, CODEBASE_SUMMARY.md, INTEGRATION_PLAN.md
- TESTING_GUIDE.md, TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md, and similar files

**Best Practice: Use a dedicated directory for these ephemeral files**

**Recommended approach:**
- Create a `history/` directory in the project root
- Store ALL AI-generated planning/design docs in `history/`
- Keep the repository root clean and focused on permanent project files
- Only access `history/` when explicitly asked to review past planning

**Example .gitignore entry (optional):**
```
# AI planning documents (ephemeral)
history/
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Clean repository root
- ✅ Clear separation between ephemeral and permanent documentation
- ✅ Easy to exclude from version control if desired
- ✅ Preserves planning history for archeological research
- ✅ Reduces noise when browsing the project

### CLI Help

Run `bd <command> --help` to see all available flags for any command.
For example: `bd create --help` shows `--parent`, `--deps`, `--assignee`, etc.

### Important Rules

- ✅ Use bd for ALL task tracking
- ✅ Always use `--json` flag for programmatic use
- ✅ Link discovered work with `discovered-from` dependencies
- ✅ Check `bd ready` before asking "what should I work on?"
- ✅ Store AI planning docs in `history/` directory
- ✅ Run `bd <cmd> --help` to discover available flags
- ❌ Do NOT create markdown TODO lists
- ❌ Do NOT use external issue trackers
- ❌ Do NOT duplicate tracking systems
- ❌ Do NOT clutter repo root with planning documents

## Landing the Plane (Session Completion)

**When ending a work session**, you MUST complete ALL steps below. Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds.

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
4. **PUSH TO REMOTE** - This is MANDATORY:
   ```bash
   git pull --rebase
   bd sync
   git push
   git status  # MUST show "up to date with origin"
   ```
5. **Clean up** - Clear stashes, prune remote branches
6. **Verify** - All changes committed AND pushed
7. **Hand off** - Provide context for next session

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds
- NEVER stop before pushing - that leaves work stranded locally
- NEVER say "ready to push when you are" - YOU must push
- If push fails, resolve and retry until it succeeds
